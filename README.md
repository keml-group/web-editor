# KEML Web editor

This is the repository of the free online [KEML web-editor](https://keml-group.github.io/web-editor/).
Since the editor code needs to remain private, this repository just holds the minified sources to display them via GitHub pages.

## Updating the editor
The editor is generated from [KemlWeb](https://github.com/keml-group/keml.web) which is private. Hence, only group members can generate a new version.
To do so, one needs to publish new code to that project's master which is then packaged and automatically shipped to this repository.
Manual pushes are only possible for owners (in emergency cases).

## License
The license of this project is that of the [group](https://github.com/keml-group).
